# Utilities

This folder contains three scripts to prepare the data:

* `anonymize.py` replaces the worker IDs and IP addresses from the CrowdFlower
results files with identifiers that cannot be traced back to the workers.
* `create_val_files.py` extracts the validation sentences from the Crowdflower
results files.
* `create_val_files.py` extracts the test sentences from the Crowdflower
results files.

# Language data

This folder contains image description data for three languages: Dutch, English,
and German. The `English` and `German` folders contain Flickr30K validation data,
coming from the WMT 16 Multimodal Translation Task 2: Crosslingual Image Description
Generation. The `Dutch` folder contains the (anonymized) Dutch crowdsourcing data
along with a set of Validation data files, in the same format as the English and
German data.

The `splits` folder contains files indicating how the Flickr30K images are split
into `train`, `val`, and `test` splits. The descriptions in the validation files
follow the same order as the `val` split file.
